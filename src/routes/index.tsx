          '''Do not make any visual modifications. The phrases I write are commands to understand what I want, not to be written down. Understand their content well, then execute what is required.'''
                                        
                                            
                                            Search every .tsx, .jsx, .ts, and .css file in this project for any element with a "hidden" class, display:none, or visibility:hidden that contains large blocks of prose text rather than real UI content or legitimate code comments. This is dead, non-functional content that should never have been added — delete every instance found, in every file, not just index.tsx. List each file and line range you removed. Then confirm the project still builds with zero TypeScript errors and paste the actual build output.

Separately, fix the Home hero's primary CTA button: set its label text to exactly "Explore Our Research", remove any background-clip:text rule on it, and give it an explicit, non-transparent text color with real contrast against its background. Paste the component's before and after code in your response.
